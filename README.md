"I got your distress call and came as quickly as I wanted to. No need to thank me."ðŸš€

I'm intersted in making the world more user friendly and intuitive. My primary focus is Web Development, but I want to branch out someday! I work in Commercial Loan Servicing, currently, but I'm looking to move into a Dev role. I'd love to collaborate on anything! The best way to get better is to make things. I love doing that and I love trouble shooting. I'm a believer in the Fediverse and ActivityPub.

For funsies, I'm a bit of a film ðŸŽ¬ buff. I especially love Sci-Fi.  I have watched every episode of Futurama THOUSANDS of times. Send me your favorite Futurama quote. 

"When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all." ðŸŒŒ
